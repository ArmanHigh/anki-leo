lingualeo-export-extension
==========================

Chrome extension to export LinguaLeo user dictionary as CSV file. Once installed it adds Export button on [dictionary page](http://lingualeo.com/userdict).

Motivation
==========

LinguaLeo word trainings lacking interval repetition support. So I decided to export my LinguaLeo dictionary to Anki via CSV.

Installation
============

Since it's not in WebStore at the moment, install it as unpacked extension:

1. Clone the repo
2. Go to Chrome -> Tools -> Extensions
3. Check 'Developer mode'
4. Click 'Load unpacked extension' and point to the 'src' folder of the repo

Todo
====

- Publish in Chrome WebStore
- Go Bower!
